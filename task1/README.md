# URL Shortener using the cutt.ly API

This is a simple Python script that allows you to shorten URLs using the [cutt.ly](https://cutt.ly/) URL shortening service. You can provide your API key and the URL you want to shorten as input, and it will generate a shortened URL for you.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this script, you need to obtain an API key from [cutt.ly](https://cutt.ly/). You can sign up for an account and get your API key from their website.

## Usage

Clone this repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/abdibrokhim/CodeClause-Internship-Solutions/tree/main/task1
```

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

Install the required packages using the following command:

```shell
pip install requests
```

Run the script using the following command:

```shell
python main.py -k YOUR_API_KEY -u YOUR_URL
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your cutt.ly API key and `YOUR_URL` with the URL you want to shorten.
